    <!--
    Create a form with a textbox and a button.
    The textbox will hold a number that will represent
    the number of rows and columns in a table.
    Once the submit button is clicked you will generate a two dimensional array
    with each of the elements of the array holding a random number between 1 and 100.
    You can convert the text box string value to a number using the parseInt() function.
    Use the following function in your code to create the random number:
        function randomNumber (min, max) {
            return Math.floor (Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
        }
    After creating the array you will loop through it
    and the number is a multiple of 3, display the cell with a red background color;
    if not a multiple of 3 but a multiple of 2, display the cell with a blue background.
    Finally, display the average for all cells.
