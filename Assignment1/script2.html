    * Write two loops,
    * one that counts from 10 to 0
    * and another that counts from 0 to 10.
    * Use a for loop for one and a while loop for the other.
    * For the third loop have a loop that will loop from 0 to 10
    * but only output the count if it is a divisible by two.
    * You will need to use a for loop and an if statement with in the loop.
    * Your logic should use the modulus operator.
    * Use console.log to display the loop count. */
